# 👋 Hey there, I'm Jorge Morua

I'm a passionate Systems Engineering student from Costa Rica, currently working as a **Junior Business Central Developer** focused on AL development and consulting. With a growing interest in **CI/CD**, **JavaScript**, and **cloud automation**, I'm on a journey to become a top developer in my field — and one day work from Europe 🌍 (Amsterdam, Florence, or Munich are on the vision board!).

---

## 🔧 What I'm Working On
- 🚀 Implementing **CI/CD pipelines** for AL extensions using GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps.
- 🔍 Learning **Power Platform**, **PowerShell scripting**, and **BC containerization**.
- 🌐 Rebuilding older PHP + Oracle projects with clean JS frontend architecture.
- ✍️ Writing blog-style content and documenting my learning publicly.
